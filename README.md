Some useful classes which are written in C++11/14/17.

All helper classes files are in the "common" directory, and functionality tests and examples for how to use them are in the "tests" directory.

I have written some CMake scripts to generate msvc projects on Windows. Make sure the CMake's version is equal to or above 3.12.4 if you want to use them. You can also compile the codes on other platforms by yourself since most of them are platform-independent.
